NeoGeo-2-Player-Tetris
======================

NeoGeo 2 Player Tetris using NeoBits NeoDev library

Just a quick 2 player tetris game I put together for the NeoGeo back in 2008.  
Rediscovered the source code recently and figured it may be useful to someone
else who wants to play around with writing code for the NeoGeo platform.  This
game is nearly complete, with a few outstanding issues.
